  <h1>Robots and Foundation Universe Timeline</h1>

  <h2>By Isaac Asimov</h2>

  <p>The Foundation and Robot series of books, written by Isaac Asimov are one of my favorite science-fiction series. I remember reading Foundation in Spanish back when I was about 10 or so... took me many readings to understand it but I felt in love with the sense of high adventure and intrigue, as frightening as some of those pieces were for someone reading the novel way before he was supposed to :)</p>

  <p>It wasn't until much later (Robots and Empire) that Asimov merged together his three series: Foundation, Robots and Empire into one big 30+ books universe that actually makes sense :-)</p>

  <p>The Robot short stories and novels before The Naked Sun and the Foundation stories after Foundation and Earth deal with issues
    related to the Three Laws Of Robotics:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm</li>
    <li>A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law</li>
    <li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second
      Law.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These three laws are deeply ingrained and embedded into the positronic brains of each robot. They cannot be disobeyed. Daneel and Giskard, another robot, introduced the Zeroth Law around 3700 C.E that states, 'A robot may not injure humanity, or through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.' This, naturally, led to a modification of the First law as follows, 'A robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm, except where that would conflict with the Zeroth Law.' These modifications, thought of as blasphemous
    by some, led to the Robotic Civil Wars between the Calvinians, strictly adhering to the original three laws, and the Giskardians, robots who had adopted the Zeroth Law.</p>

<p>The Second Foundation Trilogy, written by Greg Bear, David Brin, and Gregory Benford covers different periods ,
  introduces additional plot elements that clarify and further tin the Foundation story: Foundation's Fear (1997) takes
  place chronologically between part one and part two of Asimov's second prequel novel, Forward the Foundation;
  Foundation and Chaos (1998) is set at the same time as the first chapter of Foundation, filling in background;
  Foundation's Triumph (1999) covers ground following the recording of the holographic messages to the Foundation, and
  ties together a number of loose ends and tie together existing elements of the Foundation cannon, and
  introduces some additional threads that may be picked up in future books.</p>
