        <p>
          My search for Hari Seldon began in 1056 F.E. I had intended a simple
          assembly of Seldon’s appearances in the Time Vault at the crisis
          points of the last millennium, with my own commentary added, and had
          assumed that the research would require nothing more than routine
          retrievals. I even suspected that such a stringing together of
          Seldon’s projections already existed, perhaps with another historian’s
          commentary.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          My first surprise, as I searched through Trantor’s memory, was to find
          that no such compilation existed in the great library. I proceeded to
          gather the individual manifestations, and was startled to find only
          three of Seldon’s six appearances.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first I thought that I had simply failed to enter the retrieval
          codes correctly; but after repeated runs it became clear that three of
          the six appearances were not there. I concluded that they had to be in
          the general bank somewhere, requiring a long search, which I undertook
          -as much in a fit of pique as out of curiosity about the great
          psychohistorian’s ideas. I would locate, compile, and present in
          usable form all of Hari Seldon’s manifestations. I was good at search
          programs (colleagues of mine claimed that this was all I had ever been
          good at, though they were polite enough when they needed my skills).
          It was unthinkable that anything of Hari Seldon’s remains could have
          actually been lost, but I would make certain of that, if nothing else;
          even ascertaining such a fact would give me a place in the upcoming
          117th edition of the Encyclopedia Galactica.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three appearances were missing, even though they were cited in other
          documents. I made my count from the records, as follows: four crises
          had occurred by the time of the Mule, and for each of these Seldon had
          prepared a personal simulacrum to appear in the Time Vault, to help
          and explain. He appeared at the height of the first crisis. The second
          crisis had been successfully resolved by the time he appeared. No one
          came to listen to him at the third and fourth crisis, but records show
          that he appeared on time. The general view is that he was not needed,
          but a recording was made. The fifth appearance was well attended,
          occurring just as the Mule attacked Terminus. Seldon’s recorded words
          show him to be out of touch with events. The sixth appearance, alluded
          to in various documents, puts Hari Seldon’s image in the Time Vault on
          190 d. 1000 F.E. No one was there to listen to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Appearances two, three, and six <em>were </em>recorded-and then
          misplaced, almost as if it were feared that they might play an
          unwanted role in some upcoming development, but I found no events
          which Seldon’s words might have influenced. It seemed, therefore, that
          I also had to explain the recent lack of interest in Seldon’s ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          For nearly a month, I let loose my search programs (reflexive,
          associative, cross-referencing, and stochastic) through Trantor’s vast
          memory bank, in which are contained the accumulated history and
          knowledge of twenty-five million worlds. Here and there I found
          references to Seldon appearances two, three, and six, made by people
          who had planned to visit the Time Vault, but for one reason or another
          had been unable to arrive at the appointed time; but there was no
          reference to where I might find the record of Seldon’s appearances.
        </p>
        <p>
          My fear that these records were in fact lost grew along with the
          problems I was formulating about Seldon’s role in history. Even though
          psychohistory expressed its predictions only in terms of probable
          outcomes, there had always been about it an aura of totalitarian
          control, of an attempt by the past to shackle the future. To what
          degree had Seldon’s thousand-year plan been a self-fulfilling
          prophecy? How had it actually influenced possible outcomes? If
          psychohistory was valid, then how could it stand outside history and
          itself not be subject to its own statistical laws? Did Seldon believe
          that psychohistorical thinking was independent of history’s flow? Or
          was his plan simply an ideal? And finally, I began to wonder if
          Seldon’s appearances in the Time Vault had been of any use. What had
          been their importance, if any?
        </p>
        <p>
          These and other questions played in my mind with a thousand answers as
          I waited for my search programs to trap Seldon’s missing appearances.
          I began to feel that an unseen hand was preventing me from getting to
          the heart of the issues that churned within me. I became convinced
          that the sixth and final appearance would deliver to me the real
          motive behind Seldon’s appearances in the vault. Only that final
          manifestation, timed to occur long after the dangers to Galactic
          Civilization were past, would reveal the great psychohistorian’s
          thoughts about his plan and why he had projected himself across time.
          I began to think that Seldon’s Plan had not been inevitable, since it
          had needed a coach.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started to dream that I was in his presence at last, and he was
          talking to me, revealing secrets that only I could understand, even
          though in my waking hours I doubted that I was the only one who had
          ever inquired into these matters. But if I was the only one, then my
          fellow historians had failed to ask the greatest question in Galactic
          History: had one man truly been responsible for compressing thirty
          thousand years of decline into a millennium?
        </p>
        <p>
          If others had asked my questions, then where was their work? Why
          couldn’t I have it for the asking? Was the birth of our Galactic
          Renaissance to be shrouded in secrecy?
        </p>
        <p>
          It occurred to me at this point that I might be asking the wrong
          questions. For example, if Seldon’s Plan had been implemented
          creatively rather than fatalistically, then there would be no
          contradiction between free will and psychodeterminism. We determine
          and are determined, to one degree or another, and there is no
          difficulty in predicting what we might want to do anyway. Free will is
          the flow of determinism <em>from</em><em>within. </em>It is therefore
          not a vindication of determinism to predict what someone
          <em>may </em>do of his own free will, especially if the possible
          choices are few.
        </p>
        <p>
          This line of reasoning would mean that once Seldon’s Plan began to be
          developed by the two Foundations, he became largely irrelevant. His
          appearances in the Time Vault were inconsequential to the creative
          process he had started! Of course, few thought of it in that way, even
          though it was implicit in their failure to attend Seldon appearances
          two, three, and six.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, I needed those appearances to confirm my thinking. Was
          it Seldon’s diminishing importance that had been responsible for the
          misplacement of his last appearance, or had his confirmation of my
          line of reasoning so shocked those who had played it back later that
          they had buried it? Perhaps they had destroyed it completely, and I
          would never satisfy my intense curiosity.
        </p>
        <p>
          A vision haunted me as my search program continued its hunt-that of
          Hari Seldon tricking human history into reforming itself, by getting
          rational, purposive individuals to work at his plan, which couldn’t
          help but change as it was interpreted and applied to shifting
          circumstances by the two Foundations, left and right hands unknowingly
          working together. Did Seldon’s true greatness lie in his knowing that
          the future belonged to those who would live in it, that history is a
          transcendent problem that cannot be solved, only guided imperfectly?
        </p>
        <p>
          The answers to my questions seemed beyond reach. Oh, how I yearned to
          walk up to Seldon and demand that he present me with them! I was
          convinced that even if records had been destroyed, there had to be a
          backup somewhere in the vast forest of Trantor’s information; even an
          echo might be amplified and restored to its original form. My search
          programs were seeking something of great significance, beyond the
          exercise of mere cleverness; but no program could retrieve information
          that was hopelessly lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then one day, as I sat down at the work terminal in my apartment on
          Trantor’s 66th Polar Level, my program said, “Seldon appearances six,
          three, and two, now available, in that order. Search routine
          complete.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I sat there in surprise, staring into the empty blue glow of the
          holoblock, wondering if the program had only retrieved the previously
          available appearances through some filing error. I held my breath and
          passed my hand over the control plate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The holoblock blinked. The small figure of an old man in a wheelchair
          looked up at me, his eyes bright with understanding. I waited for him
          to speak, hoping that this was not some simple duplication of the
          known appearances.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I am Hari Seldon,” he said softly, giving the usual impression of a
          lively voice that was restraining itself, “and this will be my sixth
          and final appearance in the Time Vault. “ He paused and I leaned
          forward excitedly. This was it. I glanced at the record function. It
          was running.
        </p>
        <p>
          “A few of you may have wondered by now,” Seldon continued suddenly,
          “what use, if any, these appearances of mine will have been. They
          should have coincided with a series of crises and helped you over the
          difficult times when it might have seemed that psychohistorical
          projections were having nothing to do with actual events. I hope that
          this was only apparent, not real. The shrunken old man smiled. “For
          all I know, I may be speaking to an empty chamber in a fragmented
          galaxy which is still in a dark age. But if you are hearing me, then
          let me now claim that these appearances of mine <em>had</em> to have
          been useful, <em>one way or another.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          He pointed a bony finger at me, and it seemed that he would stand up
          from his chair and touch my face. An open book fell out of his lap
          onto the floor of that distant time.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Let me explain what I mean,” he went on. “Either I was in touch with
          the way things went, or my failure moved those of you who were in
          touch to act. Psychohistory could envision large possibilities
          correctly, but it could not project a picture of specific future
          details and the actions needed to bring them about. For the large is
          composed of countless small things, and most of the time we all live
          in small details. Some of you may now be saying that psychohistory was
          not what I made it out to be, and you will be right, in the way that
          most shortsighted minds are right. But it was, I hope,
          <em>enough </em>of what it <em>had </em>to be-a rallying cry against
          the irrational darkness that threatened to plunge the Galaxy into
          thirty thousand years of barbarism. In all human life, every day, the
          irrational has threatened to establish its reign, and has been held
          back by the two foundations of intellect and good will.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He paused and sat back contentedly, as if he knew that he had
          succeeded. “There are a few basic features to the exercise of free
          will in history,” he continued confidently. “Only probabilities can be
          predicted, but not perfectly or always. Yet in retrospect
          <em>all </em>developments are seen as having been
          <em>caused, </em>including those brought about by free choices. All
          historical developments Bow from a variety of factors, and are
          therefore explainable-but not exhaustively. Free will can operate only
          among a finite number of possible choices. No free choice is
          unconditional, or we would be able to create matter and energy from
          nothingness according to our whims.” He smiled at me, as if he knew
          all my most foolish thoughts and vain ambitions.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I focused your free will,” he said, “by helping you to choose with a
          greater awareness of possibilities, with the <em>habit </em>of looking
          ahead, and I am sure that it has brought you through your millenium of
          struggle.” He sighed. “What you will do in your new Galactic Era is
          not for me to predict. Perhaps humankind will become something better.
          For me that would be a rational intelligence which would be immune to
          psychohistorical prediction. I hope so-because otherwise your new age
          will also decay and fall, and humankind may disappear from the Galaxy,
          to be replaced by new intelligences that are even now gestating in
          those countless star systems where the worlds are not congenial to
          humanoid biologies. Our human history doesn’t even span one hundred
          thousand years, even though we filled a galaxy with our kind.
          Planetary species have existed for two hundred million years and
          passed away without attaining self-conscious intelligence. Do not let
          the accomplishment of a galactic culture lull you into a sense of
          security. Become a truly free culture, one which will not be
          susceptible to psychohistorical laws, but can fully shape its own form
          and destiny.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He smiled again, and seemed bitter. “Yes, that is my ideal of a mature
          species-one that does not need to be led by the hand. And yes,
          psychohistory does predict its own downfall as a useful way of looking
          ahead, and I do not mourn it. It worked because it counted on the
          darkness rising out of a given human nature, for as long as human
          nature remained unchanged. More than anyone, I was aware of
          psychohistory’s potential for the control of human life by the
          manipulative, which is why I always withheld a full understanding of
          its laws from my kind. Against psychohistory’s dangers as a tool of
          tyrants, I weighed thirty thousand years of darkness, which will not
          have happened, because I applied <em>just enough </em>of what I knew
          to the problem. “
        </p>
        <p>
          He peered around the bare chamber. It seemed to oppress him. “I don’t
          know what else I can tell you… except, perhaps to say that I have
          loved the noble impulses in my humankind, even as I watched you
          struggle against your inner being. You have among you positronic
          intelligences, which may already be free of human psychohistorical
          tendencies, and may help you to become free…” He leaned forward, as if
          trying to peer across time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slowly, the holoblock faded. Hari Seldon’s last appearance was over.
        </p>
        <p>
          A scene flashed into my mind. I saw the leaders of both Foundations in
          the Time Vault, listening to Seldon’s last message. Had it so shocked
          them that they had resolved never to reveal that they had attended
          this last message, or even admit that it had ever existed? Had it
          shaken their faith to realize that for a thousand years human beings
          of dedicated intellect and good will had rescued civilization by
          making Seldon’s Plan work rather than being ruled by it? Were they
          afraid that Seldon’s Plan would come to be called Seldon’s Joke?
        </p>
        <p>
          Clearly, Seldon’s Plan and the best of humanity had worked hand in
          hand, with the one needing the other. It was wrong, of course, to have
          attempted the erasure of Seldon’s last appearance &ndash; if that is what had
          happened; perhaps it had been an accident. At worst, the aim had been
          not to disillusion the faithful, some of whom might not have
          understood that their faith had been something else all along &ndash; just as
          valuable and necessary, if not the vision of bright inevitability that
          silences all doubts with certainty. They might have seen the last
          millennium as a series of chance happenings.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I gazed into the deep glow of the empty holoblock, I knew that my
          vain hope of having something for the 117th edition of the
          Encyclopedia Galactica would not be fulfilled. My disappointment was
          keen-but suddenly I stood beyond my vanity and lack of accomplishment.
          I would not erase the records of Seldon’s unknown appearances, but I
          would also not call immediate attention to my findings. The records
          would be there for others to find soon enough, as I had found them, in
          the coming age that would be free of inner constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          All around me, I realized, here on Trantor and on millions of worlds,
          the positronic intelligences were free of Seldon’s laws. We had made
          the robots in all their forms, from the simplest tools of thought and
          labor to the most sophisticated brother minds. As they developed, we
          in turn would be remade. Together we would enter entirely new currents
          of history. This, I realized with the first selfless joy of my life,
          was the growing inner strength of our renascent Galaxy, in which I now
          shared.
