<h1><span class="roboto-black">Deep Dive</span> on <span class="roboto-unic">Variable Fonts</span></h1>

<div>
  <p><span>There are several things that attracted me to <span class="roboto-smcp">Variable Fonts</span>. Some of
      these things are:</span></p>

  <ul class="large">
    <li>Reduced number of HTTP requests because we're requesting less files</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Although they are larger than individual font files they end up being smaller when compared to the
        invidual fonts for the styles we want</li>
    </ul>
    <li>We have access to larger typographical palettes</li>
    <ul>
      <li>They include multiple pre-defined combinations of axes that give a given named font styles so you don't
        have to reinvent the wheel every time</li>
      <li>It gives you access to Open Type features that further enhance the look of your text</li>
    </ul>
    <li>It teaches you about the font, how it works and what enhancements it has that you may or may not be aware
      of</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I want to explore some of the features of <span class="roboto-smcp ">OpenType</span> and <span class="roboto-smcp ">Variable
      Fonts</span> as we discuss some of their benefits and their potential drawbacks</p>

  <p>The font that I will use in this essay is <a href="https://github.com/TypeNetwork/Roboto">Roboto Variable font</a>,
    a project from <a href="https://typenetwork.com">Type Network</a>, with Google's blessing to create a variable
    font for their default. Roboto is the font used for Material Design and many other Google properties and
    projects.</p>

  <p>I will also use the CSS generated when you run your font through <a href="https://wakamaifondue.com/">Wakamai Fondue</a>, a service that will let you see what your font can do in terms of <span class="roboto-smcp">OpenType</span> features and what azes the <span class="roboto-smcp">Variable Font</span> makes available to you. </p>

  <p>For me it's the font to go to until they make the Noto super family a variable font as well.</p>
  <p><strong>Note that this is an explanation and an exploration of variable fonts. Some of the choices may not
      look good but they illustrate some aspects of variable fonts.</strong></p>

  <h2>So what's a variable font?</h2>

  <blockquote>
  <p> An OpenType variable font is one in which the equivalent of multiple individual fonts can be compactly packaged within a single font file. This is done by defining variations within the font, which constitute a single- or multi-axis design space within which many font instances can be interpolated. A variable font is a single font file that behaves like multiple fonts.</p>
  &mdash; <cite><a href="https://medium.com/variable-fonts/https-medium-com-tiro-introducing-opentype-variable-fonts-12ba6cd2369">John Hudson</a></cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>For the non-technical designer, a variable font allows you to use a single font file to represent different styles that go between the extremes of a font like thino to wide, regular to bold or regular to italics. The font has a single set of outlines and the variations are represented as deltas to the single outline stored in the font file.</p>

  <p>For example, using the same font and CSS <code>font-variation-settings</code> to generate different styles for our font.</p>

<pre class="language-css"><code>.regular {
  font-variation-settings: 'wght' 400, 'slnt' 0, 'wdth' 100;
}

.italic {
  font-variation-settings: 'wght' 400, 'slnt' -12, 'wdth' 100;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is important to note two things:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>font-variation-settings</code> is not the best way to do this, it is the way that's working now</li>
  <li>In the
  future we'll be able to use the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-4/#font-variation-props">Font Variation
    Properties</a> defined in the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-4/">CSS Fonts Module Level 4</a> but, unfortunately, it's not widely supported yet</li>
  <li>Every time that you update an individual setting, you must updated all the settings, even if they haven't changed</li>
</ul>

<h2>What are OpenType features</h2>

<p>Most OpenType fonts have features that make the font easier to work with beyond what we can do with CSS alone. Some of these features include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ligatures</li>
  <li>Small Caps</li>
  <li>Different swashes and alternate displays</li>
</ul>

<h3>How do we use them?</h3>


</section>
  <script src="js/fontfaceobserver.standalone.js"></script>
  <script>
    const roboto = new FontFaceObserver('Roboto');

    let html = document.documentElement;

    html.classList.add('fonts-loading');

    Promise.all([
      roboto.load(),
    ]).then(() => {
      html.classList.remove('fonts-loading');
      html.classList.add('fonts-loaded');
      console.log('All fonts have loaded.');
    }).catch(() => {
      html.classList.remove('fonts-loading');
      html.classList.add('fonts-failed');
      console.log('One or more fonts failed to load');
    });

  </script>
</body>
