      <h1>Post Modern</h1>
      <h2>On the lost art of writing and sending a letter.</h2>

      <p>Often, the thud of mail through the front door is met with a sigh. If it isn’t an electricity bill, it’s a
        once-in-a-lifetime promotion from a discount furniture store or a flyer from the local pizza place. The online
        world—with its minefield of political fearmongering, spam links and jealousy-inducing vacation photos from
        acquaintances—doesn’t offer much more. Has the age of meaningful correspondence come to an end? And if so, what
        have we lost along the way?</p>

      <p>The digital age has reformed both the way that we correspond and the means through which we can view others’
        correspondence. With letters, we are permitted unregulated access into the inner musings and fluctuating
        emotions
        of the author. And because of their sentimental sway they are usually lugged from one home to the next, all the
        great hopes and heartaches of a lifetime collected in a shoebox and stashed under the eaves. Emails, however,
        are
        password protected, guarded by privacy laws and unlikely to be found in an attic. Even if people did
        consciously
        donate their digital archives, these exchanges lack the same emotional resonance.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Personally, I love receiving letters, especially now that it’s so rare to get something through the
        post that isn’t junk mail,&rdquo; says Simon Garfield, a British journalist and author of <strong>To the
          Letter: A
          Celebration of the Lost Art of Letter Writing</strong>. Tracing the significance of letter writing throughout
        history—we
        have, he notes, relied upon it to communicate for more than 2,000 years—his book celebrates the legacy of
        numerous historical correspondences, like the unfolding (and then failing) relationship between Napoleon and
        his wife, Josephine. &ldquo;As someone who writes a lot of history, I don’t know where I’d be without archives
        and letters and the ability to track someone’s life and transactions through the written word,&rdquo; he adds.
        &ldquo;I don’t think we’ve become less communicative,&rdquo; Garfield observes. &ldquo;I just think the kind of
        depth and the lasting value of that communication through time has diminished.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Much of our reluctance toward letter writing boils down to convenience. The immediacy of email, and the
        omnipresence of social media, has made the delayed gratification of writing and waiting for a letter feel
        antiquated. Then there are the practicalities to contend with: a stamp to buy, the trip to a mailbox. But
        imagine
        hearing that thud through the mail slot and discovering a handwritten missive lying on the mat. Most likely it
        would be relished far more, and preserved much longer, than the email which arrives with a ping.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;We write letters in a different way than we compose emails and texts,&rdquo; Garfield continues.
        &ldquo;They tend to take longer to compose, they tend to be better composed, and they have a beginning, middle
        and an end. We tend to dash off correspondence in a digital way far faster and with probably less imagination
        and
        perhaps more exactitude. They’re great for business transactions, less so for emotional correspondence.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>As letter writing falls by the wayside, Garfield has, ironically, found himself increasingly amenable to a
        form
        of correspondence usually met with derision: the annual Christmas letter. Long mocked by the likes of the late
        journalist Simon Hoggarts—who delighted so much in their bashing that he created The Round Robin Letters, an
        anthology compiling his favorites—the Christmas letter straddles an unusual fault line. Still a letter, but,
        like
        a Facebook status update, sent to a mass audience, it’s a tradition imbued with bragging rights and
        blow-by-blow
        accounts of life’s petty grievances. Yet even with their more distasteful aspects (Hoggart’s book includes news
        of cats opening fridges and hamsters that love Puccini), Christmas letters represent a strain of personal
        letter
        writing that Garfield worries is fast becoming extinct. &ldquo;I feel warmer towards those things because,
        along
        with condolence and thank-you notes, they may be one of the last bastions to fall,&rdquo; he says.</p>
