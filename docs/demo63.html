      <p>My love of science fiction started in the early 80's when I'd sneak into my school's library scouring for good books to read in Spanish translation. It wasn't until much, much later that I discovered the Robots and Empire novels and stories.</p>

      <p>Even later on, as I was reading Prelude To Foundation that I saw a reading list tying together all the robots, empire and Foundation novels together. It's over a million words.</p>

      <p>The final piece of the puzzle is the timeline below. I first saw it on David Brin's Foundation's Triump. It puts all the writings for those stories in chronological content.</p>

      <section class="notes">

            <h2>Notes:</h2>
            <p>Timeline compiled by Attila Torkos, 1998. I transcribed it from the appendix to Foundation's Triumph.</p>

            <p>Books listed in color are chapters inside a book. The original timeline doesn't list the book, just the name of the chapter or short story</p>
