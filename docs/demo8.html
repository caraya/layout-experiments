        <p>It’s Monday night, and it is late. My mind is occupied by tomorrow’s work, but my sister sits in front of me, and
          she is asking me to talk. In a deeper way, she’s asking me to be with her, and I cannot say no. So we talk, far
          into the darkest hours of this arbitrary Monday night. But this is our time.</p>

        <p>Japanese tradition tells of ichi-go ichi-e, a concept fortified over centuries of practice that says we only have
          one meeting, at one time—our experiences with one another stand alone. Every encounter we have—a dinner, a shared
          bottle of wine, a late evening of conversation on an old red couch—will happen once, and then will never happen
          again. The circumstances surrounding an encounter, the people involved and their exact dispositions and history
          make each event unique. We may interact with the same people, within similar circumstances, but ichi-go ichi-e
          says that each interaction is an experience all unto itself, never to be re-created perfectly.</p>

        <p>Ichi-go ichi-e reminds us to be mindful, but also to be present, so we may be moved by the natural combination of
          factors at play in any moment: people, food on the table, the weather outside. In traditional Japanese Noh theater,
          actors only rehearse a few times before a performance, so the authentic interactions of the performers, along with
          the natural combination of factors present at that moment, will move the performance. Even in theater, an art where
          scripted rehearsal is typically of the utmost importance, the Japanese remind us to relinquish control.</p>

        <p>Ichi-go ichi-e holds both the purposefulness of preparation and the spontaneity of presence in perfect equilibrium.
          The culture I know and live within often celebrates polarity. We are stalwarts of the extremes, either holistically
          spontaneous or absolutely controlled. And it is the Japanese who remind us that spontaneity and intentionality
          are not mutually exclusive but become more necessary within the light of the other.</p>

        <p>Relinquishing control in my day-to-day existence does not involve a tea ceremony or improvisational acting, but the
          concept is relevant enough: I relinquish my internal script when I host friends in my home, relinquish my plans
          of going to bed early when an important conversation arises instead.</p>

        <p>For me, ichi-go ichi-e looks strangely similar to working hard and also letting go. And it makes complete sense,
          as if that’s the way all hospitality should be—purposefulness mingled with whimsy.</p>
