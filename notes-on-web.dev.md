Sarah, 

It was good to see you at CDS last week, hope everything is well. 

I have a couple questions about the web.dev results and I was hoping you could point me towards answers or resources I can use for further research. 

1. Content preloading and service workers
    * Will the service worker feed from the preloaded content? 
    * If not should we choose one over the other?
